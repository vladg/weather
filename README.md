Initial thoughts:
- app will have a main view to display weather and a settings modal to enter location
- target phone only, iPad will likely require a different UI layout
- start with a hardcoded location to get main view working, improve form there
- write in Swift, no need for pods or third party libraries, just use Apple frameworks
